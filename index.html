A soil moisture dashboard is a digital interface—often accessible via web or mobile app—that displays real-time and historical data about the amount of water present in soil, usually gathered from sensors or satellite monitoring��. These dashboards are essential tools in precision agriculture, irrigation management, and environmental monitoring, helping users make informed decisions about watering, predict drought conditions, and optimize crop yields.Key FeaturesReal-time Monitoring: Displays current soil moisture levels, often with color-coded indicators for easy interpretation (e.g., green for optimal, yellow/red for warning zones)��.Historical Data: Shows trends over time, allowing users to compare past and present conditions for better decision-making�.Threshold Alerts: Sends notifications if moisture drops below or rises above user-defined levels, helping prevent over- or under-watering��.Plant Available Water: Calculates and displays how much water is accessible to plants, which is critical for irrigation scheduling��.
